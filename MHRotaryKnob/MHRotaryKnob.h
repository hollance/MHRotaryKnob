/*
 * A rotary knob control.
 *
 * Operation of this control is similar to a UISlider. You can set a minimum,
 * maximum, and current value. When the knob is turned the control sends out
 * a UIControlEventValueChanged notification to its target-action.
 *
 * The interactionStyle property determines the way the control is operated.
 * It can be configured to act like a knob that must be turned, or to act like
 * a horizontal or vertical slider.
 *
 * The control uses two images, one for the background and one for the knob. 
 * The background image is optional but you must set at least the knob image
 * before you can use the control.
 *
 * When double-tapped, the control resets to its default value, typically the
 * the center or minimum position. This feature can be disabled with the
 * resetsToDefault property.
 *
 * Because users will want to see what happens under their fingers, you are 
 * advised not to make the knob smaller than 120x120 points. Because of this, 
 * rotary knob controls probably work best on an iPad.
 *
 * This class needs the QuartzCore framework.
